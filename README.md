# Correlated
Correlated, as of v2.1, is no longer open source for a variety
of reasons, mainly related to motivation and general conduct in
the Minecraft modding community.

All public work on Correlated 2.1 has moved to a
[new organization created for it](https://github.com/Correlated2),
as all Elytra projects are supposed to be open source.

I did not take the decision to close-source the mod lightly,
and I didn't want it to be my ultimate solution, but it was, so,
here we are. I hope you continue to enjoy the mod nonetheless.

All source code and releases prior to 2.1 are still available
in this repository, in separate branches.
